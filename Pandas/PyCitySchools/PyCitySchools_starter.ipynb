    "#Conclusions\n",
    "A number of conclusions can be drawn from the given data. We first observe the overall rates among the population as a whole, setting a baseline to compare the subsequent analyses. Right away, we see that the top 5 schools based on passing rate are charter schools, while the bottom 5 are public. In fact, charter schools have an overall passing rate of 95% whereas district schools have a rate of 74%. This is a huge gap, and more thorough analysis of the differences between the two types is needed to draw deeper conclusions. Another observation is that as a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. In fact, schools with the highest budget per student performed the worst compared to their cheaper couterparts, and this inverse relationship continues across each budget level. We also observe that smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing rates. A more thorough analyis delineating the differences between type, size, and budget is needed to uncover the underlying cause of these disparities.\n"
